### **Result**

Thus the current shunt feedback amplifier is designed and constructed  and the following parameters are calculated.
| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency | f1=7khz | f1'=5khz |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency | f2 = 8khz | fo''= 900khz |
| 3 | Bandwidth | \( BW = fh - fl = 73khz \) | \( BW = f'h - f'l = 80khz \) |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | \( A{v(mid)} = 11.12\) | \( A'{v(mid)} = 2.92 \) |
| 5 | Gain at half power point | Go = 7.86 | Go'= 2.06 |

---

**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the current shunt feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
