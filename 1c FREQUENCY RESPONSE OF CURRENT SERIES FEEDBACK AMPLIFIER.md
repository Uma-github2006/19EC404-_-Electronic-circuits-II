### **Result**

Thus the current series  feedback amplifier is designed and constructed  and the following parameters are calculated.
| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency | f1=100hz | f1'= 30hz |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency | f2=500khz | f2'=500hz |
| 3 | Bandwidth | \( BW = fh - fl = 400khz \) | \( BW = f'h - f'l = 470khz \) |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | \( A{v(mid)} = 10.31 \) | \( A'{v(mid)} = 20.73 \) |
| 5 | Gain at half power point | Go = 7hz | Go' = 20hz |

---

**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the current series feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
